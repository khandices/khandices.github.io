      <h2>Hello, I'm Khandice (she/her)</h2>You've made it to my little corner of the internet. I'm a current student at Ada's Developer Academy in Cohort 16. Some of my favorite things include:
        <ul>
          <li>Music</li>
          <li>Visual Arts</li>
          <li>Plants</li>
          <li>Thai food</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      Before I transitioned into tech, I worked in social work. I spent an ample amount of my time helping others by solving
      problems and advocating for better solutions, but realized that I wanted more from my career. After entering the world of software development, I found I was still able to help others by solving problems, but in a more quantitative and creative way. Which, I really enjoy. Technology has become such an integral part of our society, and I am excited to take part in creating projects that have an effect on that in a positive way. I began my coding journey with teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript. At Ada, I'm studying to became a fullstack software developer. I have built a foundation on the following tech stacks:
        <ul>
          <li>HMTL</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>Javascript</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>Flask</li>
          <li>SQLAlchemy</li>
          <li>Postgres</li>
          <li>Swift</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      I'm interested in contributing to the vastly growing social impacts of technology and I enjoy the idea of creating applications that create efficiency in average person's life.
